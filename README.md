# contextual-gas-prices
This repo attempts to provide a contextual view of gas prices since 1993-04-01.

Q: Why 1993-04-01?
A: That's what was readily available for my initial attempt, without any paywall.

This repo is a hobby project that was initiated after hearing/seeing many discussions/posts (over decades) referring to the price of gas under various U.S. presidents, and tying lower prices to being a better president.

Do I have an agenda wrt this topic? Not really. I've been registered as an independent my entire life, and simply believe discussions should be rooted in data, stats, a holistic view (e.g., context) and not alternative facts, heresay or snapshots.
